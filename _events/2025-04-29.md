## Abstract

Join us for an engaging meetup where we dive into the Datasync Community Toolkit, a powerful collection of packages designed to synchronize data between client and server systems. Developed under the .NET Foundation, this toolkit supports various platforms including ASP.NET Core, .NET MAUI, Uno Platform, and more.

During this session, we will explore:

Key Features: Understand the core functionalities of the Datasync Toolkit, including its support for multiple database management systems.

Getting Started: Learn how to quickly set up your own data sync server and client using the provided templates and tools.

Real-world Applications: Discover practical use cases and examples of how the Datasync Toolkit can be integrated into your projects to keep your data synchronized reliably, including working with offline scenarios.

Limitations and challenges - how we worked around them and contributed improvements to the project.

Additionally, we will discuss the challenges faced by companies in Austria, where not all businesses have reliable internet access. This meetup will provide insights into how the Datasync Toolkit can help overcome these obstacles and ensure seamless data synchronization even in less connected environments.
