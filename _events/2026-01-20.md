    Are you struggling to maintain your development environment setup? Does it take long? If so, come check out devcontainers: full-featured development containers for your dev environment. Get started with a new machine, codebase or project in minutes, not days. Clean up in seconds.

    In this session you will learn what devcontainers are, how they work and how to use and create them using clients such as the devcontainer CLI, Visual Studio Code and Rider or CodeSpaces.
    We will also cover the specification and how to make them reusable by packaging and publishing devcontainers as templates and features.
    Devcontainers are essential to a great developer experience and in this session you learn why and how.
