## Abstract

Getting fat again with WinUI 3 and the Windows App SDK but reactive by David Eiwen & Raoul Holzer

Join us for an enlightening session where our expert speakers, David and Raoul, share their journey of migrating an old Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app to the modern Windows UI Library (WinUI) 3.0 using the Windows App SDK. Through real-world examples and practical insights, theyâ€™ll discuss the challenges faced during the migration process and the innovative solutions they implemented.  
In addition, they will present how Rx.NET can be integrated well with a WinUI 3 app.
