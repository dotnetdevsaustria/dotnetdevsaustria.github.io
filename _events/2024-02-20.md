## Abstract
GitHub Copilot has been available in Visual Studio for over nearly 2 years now and we see more and more AI features popping up in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.  
All of these features are behind an additional subscription that your company or you have to pay.  
So the big question is, do you get a useful tool for this extra money? And if so, how do you convince your boss to pay for it?

Andreas tried to find an answer to this question in the last year by daily driving GitHub Copilot for various tasks at his work as a Developer.
