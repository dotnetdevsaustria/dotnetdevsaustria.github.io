## Abstract

Many developers are still using .NET Core 3.1, even though it reached EOL in 2022.  
We now have .NET 5, .NET 6, .NET 7, and .NET 8 available, each with some improvements and new functionalities.  
In this session, we're going to explore the most important things a .NET developer should know about the newest versions of the framework. Syntax improvements, new data types, and a lot more!
