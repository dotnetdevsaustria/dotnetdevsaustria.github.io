    With the latest changes to the language, C# moves into the direction of a multi-paradigm language, enabling to write code in an object oriented and also increasingly functional style. Besides the support of the language itself, railway oriented programming is a concept from the functional world that can also be leveraged in C#. In this talk David and Paul dive into the concept of railway oriented programming and what it means to use this approach in big applications. They share some experience and discuss their love-hate relationship with this approach.
