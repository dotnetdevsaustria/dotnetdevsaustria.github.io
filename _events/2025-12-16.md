    Aspire vastly improves your local developer experience, and Testcontainers can do the same for your testing experience. Use the real database (or "insert-dependency-here"), execute in parallel, and still be assured that the tests are properly isolated from each other. Testcontainer does all the hard work for you in terms of managing the container lifetime, and you can run anything from integration tests to E2E tests. Bring your dependencies, be it EF-only, ASP.NET or Azure Functions.
    
    Christoph Wille has written the first-ever book on C# in 2000 that was handed out to all attendees at the Professional Developers Conference where .NET was revealed. He has contributed ever since to various communities and open source projects (eg ILSpy), and in his day to day work is helping companies build large enterprise and/or Internet-facing solutions with .NET and Azure.
