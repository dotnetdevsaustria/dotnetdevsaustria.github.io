## Abstract
Ever wondered how to best get your ASP.NET WebForms application to .NET so you can use all the cool new features that have been released with .NET and C# in the past decade? Ever complained about how Microsoft left ASP.NET WebForms on .NET Framework when they released .NET? Then this talk might just give you the answer!

Using the newly developed CoreForms library, we will walk you through the complete migration of Microsoftâ€™s own Wingtip Toys demo application and still have time left in the hour for questions from the audience!

Some things you will see in the talk:

- ASP.NET WebForms running on .NET
- Almost no changes to the existing code base
- What to do with 3rd Party libraries such as Telerik Controls
