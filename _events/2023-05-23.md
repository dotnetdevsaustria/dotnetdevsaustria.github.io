REST Assured has been a popular API testing library in the Java ecosystem for years. Until recently, however, there has not been a library that provides a similar DSL and ease of use in the .NET ecosystem. Combine that with me looking for a project to help me sharpen my developer skills, and you get why RestAssured.Net was created.

In this talk / live coding demo, you'll see how to get started with RestAssured.Net for writing tests for your HTTP-based APIs, as well as some of its most useful features. I'll also tell you a bit about my experiences in writing, publishing and maintaining an open source library, and you'll get a glimpse of what's coming up next for RestAssured.Net
