    Legacy .NET applications often come with a painful reality: setting up a reliable local development environment feels impossible, and running meaningful integration tests is even harder. Complex dependencies, missing infrastructure, and brittle setups frequently force teams to skip tests altogether, increasing the risk of regressions and slowing down delivery.

    In this talk, you’ll discover how .NET Aspire can transform this challenge into a manageable, automated process. We’ll explore how to integrate Aspire into an existing legacy project to spin up a consistent, containerized development environment—without rewriting your application. You’ll learn how this approach makes it feasible to run integration tests that were previously out of reach, unlocking faster feedback loops and more confident deployments.
