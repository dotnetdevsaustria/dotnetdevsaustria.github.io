    As a .NET dev who thinks in events (hi, Shahab The Guy ), I’ll show how to turn app behavior into evidence you can graph, search, and trust. In 10 minutes we’ll wire up OpenTelemetry once, add Serilog for structured logs, and ship traces, metrics, and logs straight to Grafana Cloud—while also lighting up the .NET Aspire dashboard for local dev.
