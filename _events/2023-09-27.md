## Abstract

We hear about the amazing potential of LLMs all the time, but on a technical level, how do we actually include an LLM in our application?  
What implications does the inclusion of LLMs into our solution have on our user interface and architecture?  
We will also take a closer look at an example for creating our own knowledge base, and where things are currently moving.  
Some things will cover in the talk:

- How an LLM works on a basic level
- How to create a knowledge base
- An example on how to query an LLM in C#
- An example on how to create your own knowledge base with Python & LangChain
