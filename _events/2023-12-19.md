## Abstract

How much perfomance impact does logging add to a .NET application? Why is there (not) a warning? And why isn't it activated by default?

This talk will go to the bottom to answer all of these and many more (obscure) logging questions.  
Learn how to do performant logging in .NET and pick up some nice perks like structured logging, OpenTelemetry and general knowledge about performance optimization on the way.
