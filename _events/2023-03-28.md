**Abstract:**

Did you know you can create an API starting with a console app?

Welcome Minimal APIs!!! Minimal APIs were received with a lot of excitement since the very announcement of it in the preview versions of .NET 6. It is a great way to build APIs with minimal dependencies.  
In my session, we will understand the “why” and “how” of Minimal APIs while understanding the minimal hosting model. We will then look at some of the features introduced in .NET 7 for Minimal APIs and understand whether we can give our project a little bit more structure.  
We will also into versioning your APIs and finally talk about rate limiting of APIs

There will be lots of code, lots of demos, and lots of practical knowledge to take away :-)
