## Abstract

Setting up and running integration and end-to-end tests in distributed software systems is hard. Making sure that all components are deployed, with the right version, in the right state, with the right data is a challenging task for many teams.

Contract-based testing is an approach that tries to address this problem and simplify and speed up integration testing for distributed software systems.

In this talk and live demo, you'll learn about the basic principles behind contract-based testing, the questions it tries to answer, and the three different approaches to contract-based testing. You will also see contract-based testing in action, using the well-known Pact.Net library for C#. To wrap up the talk, we will also talk about how to adopt contract-based testing in your team and organization, and some of the potential pitfalls that should be addressed along the way.
