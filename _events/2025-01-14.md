## Abstract

Software development is undergoing a revolution: For many developers, AI assistance systems have become indispensable. They take on routine tasks, generate simple algorithms, create tests, document code, and much more. GitHub Copilot is considered a pioneer and market leader in this field – but strong alternatives are challenging the top player and driving innovation forward. In this session, **Rainer Stropek** provides an overview of the latest developments in GitHub Copilot and introduces exciting challengers like Cursor and Windsurf. There will also be time for an open discussion about the opportunities and risks of AI in software development.
