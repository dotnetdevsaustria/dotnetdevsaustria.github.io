## Abstract

.NET Aspire is an opinionated, cloud-ready stack for building observable, production-ready, distributed applications.  
For some months it is GA but the development continues and continues.  
Martin gives us an overview of the best features of Aspire. And perhaps he shows us some hidden ones too!
