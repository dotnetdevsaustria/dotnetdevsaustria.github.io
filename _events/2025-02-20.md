## Abstract

Debugging and optimizing applications can often feel like navigating in the dark. Traditional log files are disorganized, verbose, and challenging to interpret, leaving teams overwhelmed and searching for a signal in a sea of noise. This issue isn’t limited to complex, distributed systems—it happens even in ordinary applications, where logs fail to provide clarity. Compounding the problem is the uncertainty about the time and effort needed to achieve specific performance levels. Without clear insights into bottlenecks, it’s difficult to know where to focus or whether your efforts will yield meaningful results.

But what if you could replace the chaos with clarity? What if troubleshooting felt like uncovering the full picture—precise, contextual, and actionable? And what if you could predict and measure the impact of your performance optimizations, removing the guesswork? Observability makes this possible by transforming the way we monitor and debug systems.

In this talk, Andreas Willich from TechTalk and ZZZZZZZZZ from XXXLutz will demonstrate how observability can tackle both challenges head-on. Using a real-world application built with MongoDB and Apache Kafka, they’ll show how rich traces, real-time metrics, and actionable visualizations enable faster root cause analysis, more efficient optimizations, and a clearer path to achieving your performance goals. Join us to uncover how observability empowers you to understand, improve, and take control of your systems.
